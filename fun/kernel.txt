Dear mommy, i didn't mean to fuck the dog.

i think he liked it though.

i guess its just part of growing up.

i tried to make it up to him and fuck him a little
 less than the last time, but maybe that was just a good excuse.

the biggest news was that i got a job at
 the club i worked at during the summer for the whole school year.

the club is called tiger's & tigers and they cater mainly to young college guys.

it is kind of hard to imagine that i got hired, anyways the dog 
that i fucked on the first day seems to have taken
 to me because i haven't seen him yet this week.

what else is new?

oh, that class that i signed up for ended
 up being so boring that i spent two hours on my day
 ,yesterday the dog that i fucked fucked me again!
  he was riding me and then he was on top and 
 he fucked me right through my jeans.

he took me outside and fucked me right on the front lawn.

it was freezing but we didn't care because he was nice to us and everything.

what else?

i can't remember anything.

maybe it is because i am old.

i have so much going through my head that i can't focus on the right thing.

maybe its because of the drugs or because of the dog that i fucked yesterday.

maybe it is because of everything.
 
 Regards, Tony

P.S : I also fucked a cat :troll:
